- 👋 Hi, I’m Refujio Colmenero
- 👀 I’m interested in art, music, photography, nature, and best of all, data.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my MIS degree through SNHU and also getting certs through Data Quest to be a Data Scientist.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on database analysis, maybe even go out and collect my own data over a certain topic and create my own database. 
- 📫 If at all interested, text me at 817-204-9488 or look me on on LikedIn ----> https://www.linkedin.com/in/refujio-colmenero/
